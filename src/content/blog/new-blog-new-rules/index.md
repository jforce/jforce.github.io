Welcome to yet another iteration of my blog! Over the years I’ve spun up a handful of blogs only to abandon them when the pressure to make everything perfect sucked the joy out of writing. This time, I’m doing things a little differently.

My approach to this blog will be one of my personal notepad – somewhat of microblog, a space for quick thoughts, "Today I Learned" (TILs), and fleeting ideas.

For more polished articles, you can check out my work on [redhat.com](https://www.redhat.com/en/authors/james-force) and [developers.redhat.com](https://developers.redhat.com/author/james-force). But here will be where the unfiltered, raw stuff lives. Let’s see how far this version makes it!
