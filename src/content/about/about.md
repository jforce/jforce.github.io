Welcome to my personal website! I’m James Force, and I use this site as an open notebook to document my thoughts and experiences with computers and technology.

My work namely focuses on designing and building large-scale, mission-critical platforms. I specialize in a wide range of technologies, including Linux, Kubernetes, Istio, Ceph, and Ansible. I am a strong advocate of [open source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source), the [UNIX philosophy](https://cscie2x.dce.harvard.edu/hw/ch01s06.html), and the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org).

While I have expertise in specific technologies, I don’t limit myself to them. I value versatility and strong fundamentals. In my opinion, the ability to quickly read, comprehend, and analyze is the most important skill an engineer can have... that, and tenacity. Plus, learning new things is always fun.
