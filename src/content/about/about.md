My work these days namely focuses on designing and building large-scale, mission-critical platforms. I specialize in a wide range of technologies, including Linux, Kubernetes, Istio, Ceph, and Ansible. I am a strong advocate of [open source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source), the [UNIX philosophy](https://cscie2x.dce.harvard.edu/hw/ch01s06.html), and the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org).

You can find other articles of mine on [redhat.com](https://www.redhat.com/en/authors/james-force) and [developers.redhat.com](https://developers.redhat.com/author/james-force).
